/*2. Create three classes: Employee, Manager, and Director. Each class should have a data
member called salary representing the salary of the respective role. Create another class called
SalaryReport which should inherit from Employee, Manager, and Director classes. The
SalaryReport class should have a member function called calculateAverageSalary() that
calculates the average salary of all the roles and stores it in a data member called
averageSalary. Display the average salary using the displayAverageSalary() member function.*/
